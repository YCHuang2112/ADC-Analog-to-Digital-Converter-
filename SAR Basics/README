To run: Open SAR_Switching_Energy.m in Matlab and execute it.


Explanation: This file only contain tree switching schemes:  
    i)      Conventional switching Scheme (CS) 
    ii)     Monotonic switching Scheme  (MS)
    iii)    Merge Capacitor switching Scheme (MCS)
    
   And basically, they can be divided into two types of CDAC sampling categories:  
   i)  Bottom-plate sampling:  CS
   ii) Top-plate sampling: MS and MCS
   
   CDACs of all the swithing schemes are binary-weighted CDACs.
   
   This file shows:
   i) Energy consumption (C_u(V_ref)^2) of each code. (C_u is the unit capacitance of the CDAC, V_ref^2 is the reference voltage) 
   ii) Energy of each swithing on the CDAC
   iii) Average switching Energy of each bit
   iv) Average switching Energy of each scheme
   v) Normalized swithing Energy of each scheme (Average switching energy of each switching scheme with repect to CS' average switching energy)
   
   To set the bit (resolution) of the SAR, please change the parameter B_SAR in the file: SAR_Switching_Energy.
